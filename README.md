# Components

A hacker-friendly collection of React components.

Lightweight, and written with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), the components are intended for forking, rather than being bloated with configuration for every variant imaginable.

They can, of course, be imported and customised by [configuring tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) or passing tailwind classes through `className` â€“ that's certainly not a bad option for prototypes. But, for any serious customisation, I find it makes most sense just to copy the components over to the new project and tweak to taste.

The components take a fair bit of inspiration from [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com). I use Whimsical for prototyping (and love it) so it's dead handy to have a set of components that loosely map to its design system.
